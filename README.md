This is a experimental loudspeaker project that is completely designed using the parametric CAD tools provided by OpenSCAD. In order to deal with this source code you'll need to install OpenSCAD, following the instructions at: www.openscad.org

The main case is built by using CNC milling from 10mm plywood. Decor was made from 3mm plywood by laser cutting.
